# Op3n
Hey, we’re Op3n, and we enable on-chain wallet-to-wallet communication.


NFT buyers need to use social media like Twitter to contact other NFT holders for trading or collaboration, and at times can’t even reach out due to anonymity.  

We at Op3n solve this problem using our unique on-chain NFT and IPFS-based communication and trading dapp.

We help you connect, collaborate, and transact your NFTs and tokens. Just like eBay or Kijiji for physical items, you can contact owners to discuss potential trades and collaboration opportunities.


With NFT aggregator solutions like gem.xyz selling over 1.9 million NFTS all time and Cow Swap with a trading volume of over $20 billion, this proves there’s a large market we can tap into.

It's time to unlearn the limitations of the world wide web and learn a new way to engage and transact openly in the digital world.
